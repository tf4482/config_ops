# ⚙️ config_ops

> 🪄 Configuration-driven Windows automation scripts for recurring local, network, and file-management tasks.

The project is intentionally script-oriented: each root script owns its own `config.yaml` section, adds an example section when missing, and delegates reusable Windows-specific helpers to the `winutils_python` submodule.

## 🧰 Current tools

- 💾 `file_operations.py` runs named Robocopy operation sets for mirror, copy, and move jobs.
- 🖼️ `archive_media.py` moves configured media files into dated `YYYY/MM/DD` archive folders.
- 🕒 `adjust_file_creation_date.py` applies Windows file times from filename, folder-name, or embedded media metadata timestamps.
- 🔌 `connect_smb.pyw` connects configured SMB network shares without opening a terminal window.
- 🚀 `ssh_tasks.py` runs named SSH command sets.
- 💡 `peripherals.pyw` toggles simple URL-controlled peripherals and stores state in the Windows registry.
- 📦 `deploy.py` compiles root `.py` and `.pyw` scripts with PyInstaller and deploys executables from `dist`.
- 🧩 `winutils_python/` contains reusable helper modules for config handling, SMB, Robocopy, menus, and terminal visuals.

## ✅ Requirements

- 🪟 Windows
- 🐍 Python `>=3.13`
- ⚡ `uv`
- 🔐 OpenSSH tools when using `ssh_tasks.py` or remote deployment in `deploy.py`
- 💾 `robocopy` for file operations
- 🔌 `net use` for SMB mappings
- 🌐 `curl.exe` for `peripherals.py`

## 🚀 Setup

After cloning, initialize the submodule and sync dependencies:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
uv sync
```

This is an application-style `uv` project. The local `winutils_python` submodule is declared as an editable dependency in `pyproject.toml`.

## 🧭 Configuration model

All root scripts read `config.yaml` next to the script or compiled executable. When a section is missing, the script appends a default example section and exits so the file can be configured first.

Before running task work, root scripts validate required options with `winutils_python/config_validation.py` and print the exact missing config keys, such as `adjust_file_creation_date.test.mode` or `smb.mappings[1].share`.

Named-set tools accept a set name as the first argument. If no argument is provided, they use the shared terminal menu from `winutils_python/menu.py`.

Named-set tools:

- 💾 `file_operations.py`
- 🖼️ `archive_media.py`
- 🕒 `adjust_file_creation_date.py`
- 🚀 `ssh_tasks.py`

Example:

```powershell
uv run python file_operations.py backup
uv run python archive_media.py phone_photos
uv run python adjust_file_creation_date.py screenshots
uv run python ssh_tasks.py manual_backup
```

Without an argument:

```powershell
uv run python file_operations.py
```

The script prints available sets and asks for a number or name.

## 🔌 SMB connections

Top-level `smb` defines credentials and mappings. Scripts that support SMB opt in per selected set with `smb: true`.

Top-level SMB config requires `smb.user` and `smb.mappings`; every mapping requires `drive` and `share`.

Per set, `smb` can be:

- 🚫 `false` or omitted to skip SMB connections
- ✅ `true` to use the top-level `smb` configuration

When SMB is enabled and no encrypted password is stored, the password is prompted and then persisted in `config.yaml` as an obfuscated value. Legacy `password` and `password_file` values are removed after storing the encrypted password.

`connect_smb.pyw` directly connects the top-level SMB mappings. Its subprocess calls use Windows no-console creation flags in `winutils_python/connect_smb.py`, so running the `.pyw` script does not open terminal windows for `net use`.

## 💾 File operations

`file_operations.py` runs one named set from `file_operations`.

Supported operation groups:

- 🪞 `mirror`
- 📋 `copy`
- 📦 `move`

Each operation group can be either a list of tasks or a table with `tasks`, `overwrite`, and `options`.

Each configured operation task must define `source` and `target`; missing task values are reported before Robocopy starts.

Robocopy exit codes below `8` are treated as successful outcomes. Exit codes `8` and above are collected, summarized, and raised after all configured operations have run.

## 🖼️ Media archive

`archive_media.py` runs one named set from `archive_media`.

For each task:

- 📂 `source` must exist and must be a directory.
- 🎯 `target` is created as needed.
- ✅ `source` and `target` are required and reported before archive work starts when missing.
- 🔎 Matching files are moved recursively.
- 📅 File creation time determines the destination folder.
- ♻️ Existing destination files or folders with the same name are removed before moving.
- 🧾 Task failures are collected while later tasks continue.

## 🕒 File creation date adjustment

`adjust_file_creation_date.py` runs one named set from `adjust_file_creation_date`.

Required values:

- 🧭 `mode` selects how timestamps are found.
- 📂 `source_folder` is the folder to process.
- 📎 `extensions` is a non-empty list of file extensions to process.

Modes:

- 🧭 `mode: file` parses timestamps from filenames and processes only files directly inside `source_folder`.
- 🗂️ `mode: folder` recursively processes matching files below `source_folder` and parses the timestamp from each file's containing folder name. Files directly inside a date-named `source_folder` use the `source_folder` name itself.
- 🧾 `mode: metadata` recursively processes matching files below `source_folder` and reads embedded media timestamps instead of filename/folder regex patterns.

Pattern-based modes:

- 🧩 `mode: file` and `mode: folder` require a non-empty `patterns` list.
- 🧩 Regex patterns must define `year` or `year2`, plus `month` and `day`.
- ⏱️ Optional regex groups are `hour`, `minute`, and `second`.

Metadata mode:

- 📷 Image metadata support: EXIF timestamps from `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tif`, and `.tiff` files.
- 🎞️ Video metadata support: QuickTime/MP4 movie-header creation timestamps from `.mp4`, `.mov`, `.m4v`, `.3gp`, and `.3g2` files.
- 🧾 `patterns` is not required for `mode: metadata`.
- 🔁 `hour_adjustment` is still applied after reading the embedded metadata timestamp.

Output behavior:

- ✍️ `change_files_in_place: true` updates matching source files directly.
- 📋 `change_files_in_place: false` copies matching files to `target_folder` or to a `changed_date` folder below the source folder.
- 🗂️ Folder and metadata modes preserve the source subfolder structure below the target folder when copying.
- 🚫 If the output folder is inside `source_folder`, it is excluded from processing to avoid reprocessing copied output files.
- 🛡️ `overwrite: false` creates collision-safe suffixed names like `image_1.jpg`.
- 🧾 Individual file failures are collected while later files continue.

## 🚀 SSH tasks

`ssh_tasks.py` runs one named set from `ssh`.

Required values:

- 👤 `user`
- 🖥️ `host`
- 🔢 `port`
- ⌨️ `command`

Optional value:

- ⏳ `timeout`

The port must be in the range `1..65535`. Timeout must be a positive number when configured. Missing `ssh.exe`, timeouts, and non-zero SSH exit codes are reported clearly.

Missing required SSH values are reported before `ssh.exe` is started.

## 💡 Peripherals

`peripherals.pyw` controls configured devices by calling their `on` and `off` URLs with `curl.exe`.

Usage examples:

```powershell
uv run python peripherals.pyw
uv run python peripherals.pyw led on
uv run python peripherals.pyw tv toggle
uv run python peripherals.pyw suspend
```

Supported commands:

- ✅ `on`
- 🚫 `off`
- 🔁 `toggle`
- 💤 `suspend`
- ⏯️ `resume`

If no device is selected, the command is applied to all configured devices. If no command is selected, `toggle` is used. Device state is stored under `peripherals.registry_path` in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`.

Each configured peripheral device must define `on` and `off` URLs. Missing device URLs and missing `peripherals.registry_path` are reported before URL triggers run.

## 📦 Deployment

`deploy.py` finds root `.py` and `.pyw` scripts, excluding itself, compiles them with PyInstaller, and deploys the executables from `dist`.

Deployment targets:

- 🏠 local `%USERPROFILE%\bin`
- 🌐 remote `%USERPROFILE%\bin` over `scp`

The script no longer uses a separate `release` directory. `dist` is cleaned after deployment, and generated `.spec` files are removed.

## 🧩 Helper modules

The `winutils_python` submodule provides reusable helpers:

- 📝 `config.py` for YAML parsing, dumping, scalar parsing, and table validation.
- ✅ `config_validation.py` for reusable missing-configuration reporting in root scripts.
- 🔌 `connect_smb.py` for password obfuscation and SMB `net use` mapping logic.
- 💾 `file_ops.py` for Robocopy command construction and operation-set execution.
- 📋 `menu.py` for shared terminal selection menus.
- 🎨 `visual.py` for terminal-aware status output.

Root scripts still own project-specific `config.yaml` loading, default-section creation, and persistence decisions. Shared validation helpers only report missing or empty required options; scripts still perform their own type and value validation where needed.

## 🚧 Status

The project is usable for Windows automation workflows but remains script-first and configuration-format changes are still possible. Current root scripts fail early with exact missing configuration keys before starting destructive or external operations.
